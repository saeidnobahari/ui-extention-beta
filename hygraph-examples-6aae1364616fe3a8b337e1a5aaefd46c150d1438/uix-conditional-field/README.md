# UI Extensions x Conditional Fields

[Join our Slack](https://slack.hygraph.com)

UI extension to show how to change visibility for other fields and use `fieldConfig`

## How to Use

Deploy the code to Vercel, or run locally, and install on Hygraph as a UI extension using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension, and run the compatibility test.

You can get started with our hosted example, but you should deploy and maintain this on your own host: `https://hygraph-uix-conditional-field.vercel.app/`

Follow the docs about [Hygraph UI extensions](https://hygraph.com/docs/ui-extensions).
