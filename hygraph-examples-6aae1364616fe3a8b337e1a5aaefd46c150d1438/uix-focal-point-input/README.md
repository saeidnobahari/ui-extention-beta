# UI Extensions тип Focal Point

[Join our Slack](https://slack.hygraph.com)

This is a simple example to demonstrate how to use [@graphcms/uix-sdk](https://github.com/hygraph/uix-sdk/) with vanilla JS.

## How to Use

Deploy the code to Vercel, or run locally, and install on Hygraph as a UI extension using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension, and run the compatibility test.

You can get started with our hosted example, but you should deploy and maintain this on your own host: `https://hygraph-uix-focal-point.vercel.app`

Follow the docs about [Hygraph UI extensions](https://hygraph.com/docs/ui-extensions).

### Download Manually

```bash
npx degit hygraph/hygraph-examples/uix-focal-point-input uix-focal-point-input
```

Install & Run:

```bash
cd uix-focal-point
npx http-server
```
